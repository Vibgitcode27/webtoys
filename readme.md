# WebToys

A static web implementation of [DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys) built with Next.js

## what is it?

A handy and easy-to-use collection of tools every developer needs at one point or another.

## why?

Because not everyone is a Windows user :)

## note

This is in the very early stages of development. Currently the only thing that sort of works is the HTML encoder/decoder. I am aiming for 1:1 feature parity with DevToys (aside from the CLI) eventually.
