## what is it?

A handy and easy-to-use collection of tools every developer needs at one point or another. It's a web-based implementation of [DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys) built with Next.js.

## why?

Because not everyone is a Windows user :)

## status

WebToys is in the very early stages of development. Most tools are not implemented. I am aiming for 1:1 feature parity with DevToys eventually, wherever that's feasible.

Below is a list of things to do; feel free to contribute if any of them appeal to you!

- [x] generalize components like buttons and sections for quick reusability
- [ ] make styles easier to read
- [ ] write type declarations where needed so that it can build
  - [ ] component props
- [ ] finish making all the tools
- [ ] remove unused imports (mdi icon paths, for example)
- [ ] ensure responsiveness on every component
- [ ] ensure accessibility on every component
- [ ] ensure everything looks good in light and dark mode
- [ ] test PWA and make sure it works offline
- [ ] add support for translating
